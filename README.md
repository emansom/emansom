# About me
Site Reliability Engineer with an itch for detail, usually untangling stack traces towards an patch. Be it towards source code, configuration state, package manager build systems or toggling bits in compiled binaries.

# Creative leisure
In my off time I pursue personal projects, one of late is [php-dqlite](https://github.com/emansom/php-dqlite). It's a wrapper around Canonical's [distributed SQLite engine](https://dqlite.io/). It allows developing linear scalable RDBMS powered web applications without the hastle of having to deal with the usual main -> replica and ProxySQL infrastructure cost.
